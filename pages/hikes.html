            <strong>Yosemite National Park </strong><br>Not just a great
            valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite,
            the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility
            of the High Sierra. First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park
            is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square
            miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant
            sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.
